# tcl-promise-spec

openSUSE RPM spec for tcl-promise.

[tcl-promise](http://tcl-promise.magicsplat.com/) implements
the promise abstraction for asynchronous programming.

Promises are concurrency primitives that let you write asynchronous code
in a sequential style. This Tcl based implementation is mostly modeled on
the Javascript/ECMAScript standard.
